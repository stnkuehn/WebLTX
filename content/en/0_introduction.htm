<p>
WebLTX is a slim and lightweight framework for publishing of scientific and mathematical content in the internet. WebLTX was inspired by LaTeX, which is already in use since decades for publishing in print media. Contrary to LaTeX does WebLTX not generate PDF but cross-linked web pages like this one.
</p>

<p>
WebLTX is no LaTeX. But it has similar advantages. WebLTX is, for example, able to create numbers and links for sections, equations, and figures only by means of textual labels. Furthermore it manages the complete layout of the web page so that the user has no need to bother about it. Another mentionable advantage is the integrated translator for LaTeX equations into MathML/HTML5 expressions.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to LaTeX, in WebTTX the user writes the content in common HTML. Furthermore there is no compiling step. That means that every change in the HTML code becomes visible directly after a browser reload.
</p>

<p>
For the operation of WebLTX only PHP is needed. That means in particular that there is no necessity to install databases or other third party software. That makes it possible to run WebLTX on almost every available web hosting service.
</p>

<p>
WebLTX was developed and intended to support the fast, free and professional distribution of new scientific ideas. It is freely available and can be redistributed and modified under terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses">GNU General Public License</a>.

<p>
Installing WebLTX is done by copying all files and directories of the framework in the directory where the web server expects its content. For Apache is this <var>/var/www</var>. Further informations you can find in the documentation of your webserver.
</p>

<p>
There are a few things to configure. In the file <var>user_settings.php</var> in the root directory of WebLTX you can perform some basic settings. Banner and favicon you can find in subdirectory <var>template</var>.
</p>

<?php DefSection('Internal Structure of WebLTX','Internal Structure','Interne Struktur')?>

<p>
WebLTX has only a few files. All of them, except <var>index.php</var> and <var>user_settings.php</var>,
are stored in subdirectories.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><var>src</var></td>
<td>Contains the PHP source code. Here is implemented the HTML interpreter. There is no need to change something here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><var>template</var></td>
<td>The directory contains files which defines the layout, like CSS, template and header image (banner). Advanced users can modify this files to change the look of their webpages according to their preferences.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><var>content</var></td>
<td>The actual content. The directory itself has one or more subdirectories with different language codes, e.g. <var>en</var> for English and <var>de</var> for German. The set of supported languages can be defined in the file <var>user_settings.php</var>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><var>cache</var></td>
<td>This directory is created by the framework. It contains temporary files, which accelerates the interpretation of the HTML code. The cache can be deleted to any time without consequences.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><var>log</var></td>
<td>The framework generates logfiles here. The directory can be deleted to any time.</td>
