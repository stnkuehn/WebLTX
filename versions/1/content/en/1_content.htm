<?php DefTopAnchor('Usage','Usage',2)?>

<?php DefChapter('Creating content','Creating content','Inhalte erstellen')?>

<?php DefSection('Basics','Basics','Grundlegendes')?>

<p>
The directory for the content is <var>versions/$(VERSIONNBR)/content</var> followed by a language code. In the configuration file <var>user_settings.php</var> (See here <?php Ref('Interne Struktur')?>) it can be determined which languages are available. Take care that the codes are valid country codes defined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1</a>.
</p>

<p>
WebLTX processes normal HTML, extended with <?php RefFree('Funktionen','embedded PHP function calls')?>. Every language directory may contain one or more HTML files. 
The rule is that everything what is inside of a HTML file is also visible together in the browser window. That is even true if a HTML file contains more than one chapter or only parts of them. Expressed in a different way, a HTML file can be considered as 
the same as what a page represents in a book. Contrary to a book, WebLTX pages can have very different sizes.
</p>

<p>
If there is more than one HTML file, the alphabetical order of the file names determines the order of headlines and sections. For this reason it is recommended to give every file a page number prefix.
</p>

<?php DefSection('Available Functions','Functions','Funktionen')?>

<?php DefSubSection('Captions','Captions','Ãœberschriften')?>

<p>
There are four levels of captions:
<ul>
<li>chapters</li>
<li>sections</li>
<li>subsections</li>
<li>sub-subsections</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Chapters can be defined with
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefChapter('Name','Shortname','Label')?&gt;
</pre></div>
<var>Name</var> is in this context the full caption of the chapter and used in the text body. The <var>Shortname</var> is optional and intended for the menu on the left side. The <var>Label</var> is optional too. Without label the caption has no number and cannot be referenced or linked (Note, that it is however possible to jump to the caption if you define a hidden anchor with <?php RefFree('Anker','<var>DefHiddenAnchor</var>')?>).
</p>

<p>
Sections can be defined with
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefSection('Name','Shortname','Label')?&gt;
</pre></div>
and subsections with
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefSubSection('Name','Shortname','Label')?&gt;
</pre></div>
The parameters have the same meaning like in <var>DefChapter</var>.
</p>

<?php DefSubSection('Formulas and mathematical Expressions','Formulas','Formeln')?>

<p>
Like in LaTeX, there are two different types of formulas in WebLTX:
<ul>
<li>text formulas which are embedded in the floating text and</li>
<li>equation blocks with numbering.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A text formula is usually short and normally it is used only for simple relations. Often it consists only of a single symbol for a physical quantity or something comparable. 
</p>

<p>
You can define a text formula with
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefEqn('a^2 = b^2 + c^2')?&gt;
</pre></div>
The output appears in the floating text like this one: <?php DefEqn('a^2 = b^2 + c^2')?>. It contains no numbering. The syntax is the same like in LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
If you want to give an equation a number for a later reference, you can define the formula with:
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefEqnB('f(x) = \sqrt{1 -x^2}','Label')?&gt;
</pre></div>
The output looks like:
<?php DefEqnB('f(x) = \sqrt{1 -x^2}','formel1')?>
By the way, a block formula can be emphasised with <var>DefEqnBImp</var>. The formula appears in the block form:
<?php DefEqnBImp('E = m\,c^2')?>
</p>

<p>
Block formulas can be referenced from everywhere in the text. See section <?php RefByTitle('Referenzen')?> for details.
</p>

<?php DefSubSection('Figures and Pictures','Figures and Pictures','Abbildungen')?>

<p>
A picture is worth a thousand words. But nevertheless pictures should always have a description text and a number. In WebLTX figures are inserted with
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefFigure('Filename','Description','Format-Options','Label')?&gt;
</pre></div>
It is important to mention that the path and the name of the image file <var>Filename</var> has to be given relative to the content directory. The parameters <var>Description</var> and <var>Label</var> are self-descriptive. With parameter <var>Format-Options</var> the appearance of the picture can be controlled in large scale, because this string is appended at the HTML <var>style</var> variable.
</p>

<p>
Here an example. The code
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefFigure('../../images/example.svg','Description','width:60%;margin-left:10%','figure1')?&gt;
</pre></div>
results in 
<?php DefFigure('../../images/example.svg','Description','width:60%;margin-left:10%','figure1')?>
</p>

<p>
By the way, the image itself was created with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipe7/">program ipe</a>. It is very well suited for the generation of  scalable vector graphics in EPS and PDF. A conversion to SVG is also possible (with <var>iperender -svg</var>). An especially useful feature of ipe is the possibility to embed LaTeX code in the image.
</p>

<?php DefSubSection('References and Links','References and Links','Referenzen')?>

<p>
Every object with a number can be referenced and linked in different ways. The methods vary in the link's description text. For example, it is possible to refer to the same caption via title <?php RefByTitle('Funktionen')?>, short title <?php RefByShortname('Funktionen')?>, number <?php Ref('Funktionen')?> or <?php RefFree('Funktionen','with a freely chosen text')?>.
</p>

<p>
Here are the corresponding PHP codes:
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php RefByTitle('Funktionen')?&gt;
</pre></div>
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php RefByShortname('Funktionen')?&gt;
</pre></div>
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php Ref('Funktionen')?&gt;
</pre></div>
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php RefFree('Funktionen','with a freely chosen text')?&gt;
</pre></div>
</p>

<?php DefSubSection('Anchors','Anchors','Anker')?>

<p>
Anchors are invisible markers in the text. Currently, there are only two different functions.	
</p>

<p>
Bookmarks for the topmost horizontal menu bar can be defined with <var>DefTopAnchor</var>. For example, the leftmost entry was created with
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php DefTopAnchor('Introduction','Introduction',1)?&gt;
</pre></div>
By clicking this link you will come to the point where the anchor was defined. The number (here 1) is important for the order of the book marks.
</p>

<p>
The second possible anchor type is the hidden anchor, which can be defined by <var>DefHiddenAnchor</var>. With the hidden anchor it is possible to link to a page, which would be otherwise unreachable. An example for the usage of a hidden anchor is the page <?php RefFree('impressum','Impressum')?>.
</p>


<?php DefSubSection('Bibliography','Bibliography','Literaturverzeichnis')?>

<p>
WebLTX makes it easy to cite literature. With 
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php Cite('Feynman1985')?&gt;
</pre></div>
it is everywhere possible to insert a marker like this <?php Cite('Feynman1985')?>. The label <var>'Feynman1985'</var> must exist in a BibTeX file. Path and name of the BibTeX file has to be set in the configuration file <var>user_settings.php</var>. 
</p>

<p>
The output of the bibliography occurs when the function 
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;?php Bibliography()?&gt;
</pre></div>
appears. The output looks like this
<?php Bibliography()?>
The bibliography contains only such entries which was cited in the text with <var>Cite</var> or <var>NoCite</var>. That means that the BibTeX file can contain many more entries, than the final bibliography has.
</p>
