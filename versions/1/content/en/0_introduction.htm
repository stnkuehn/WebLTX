<p>
WebLTX is a slim and lightweight framework for publishing scientific content in the internet. Example was <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, which is the standard for print media since decades. Contrary to LaTeX, WebLTX produces no PDF but cross-linked websites like this one. Similar to LaTeX is that WebLTX can automatically produces numbers for equations, figures and headlines. Furthermore it formats the output and creates links when needed. Formulas can be inserted in LaTeX syntax because of <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. Since version 1.0, WebLTX supports <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX">BibTeX files</a> and permalinks.
</p>

<p>
The content is written in HTML instead of LaTeX markup language. WebLTX needs furthermore no separate compiling step, that means that every change in the HTML is immediately visible after a browser refresh. WebLTX needs only PHP but no databases. For that reason, it can be used on almost every web server. 
</p>

<p>
WebLTX was developed, to support a fast, free and professional distribution of new scientific ideas. It is freely available under terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses">GNU General Public License</a>. WebLTX can be <a href="https://github.com/stnkuehn/WebLTX"><b>downloaded here</b></a>.

Banner, favicon, template file and the CSS files are located in <var>versions/$(VERSIONNBR)/template</var>.
